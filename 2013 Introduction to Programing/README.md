### Homework 1: Leibniz and Montecarlo Methods to Aproximate PI ###

This Homework consists in creating a program that estimates pi through the Leibniz Formula and through Montecarlo Simulations. 

**Input:** Number of iterations. The user adds the number of iterations to simulate, it requires the input to be a positive number and if it's a float it will consider the input as an int.

**Sample Output:** This example shows a result printed after providing an input of 3 (The more iterations, the more precise the model becomes).

N  | Leibniz | Error | Montecarlo | Error
------------- | -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------
1 	| 4.0 |	 27.323954473516267 |	 4.0 |	 27.323954473516267
2 	| 2.666666666666667 	| 15.117363684322484 	| 2.0 	| 36.33802276324187
3 	| 3.466666666666667 	| 10.347427210380772 |	 4.0 	| 15.117363684322498

### Homework 2: Hangman Game ###

A hangman Game has been created using tkinter. Additionaly a txt dictionary of english words is imported and the word is selected randomly. The game verifies if you win or loose and lets you restart the game with a new word.
