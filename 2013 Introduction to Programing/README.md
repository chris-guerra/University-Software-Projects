### Homework 1: Leibniz and Montecarlo Methods to Aproximate PI ###

This Homework consists in creating a program that estimates pi through the Leibniz Formula and through Montecarlo Simulations. 

**Input:** Number of iterations. The user adds the number of iterations to simulate, it requires the input to be a positive number and if it's a float it will consider the input as an int.

**Sample Output:** This example shows a result printed after providing an input of 3 (The more iterations, the more precise the model becomes).

N  | Leibniz | Error | Montecarlo | Error
------------- | -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------
1 	| 4.0 |	 27.323954473516267 |	 4.0 |	 27.323954473516267
2 	| 2.666666666666667 	| 15.117363684322484 	| 4.0	| 27.323954473516267
3 	| 3.466666666666667 	| 10.347427210380772 |	 2.6666666666666665 	| 57.55868184216125

### Homework 2: Hangman Game ###

A hangman Game has been created using tkinter. Additionaly a txt dictionary of english words is imported and the word is selected randomly. The game verifies if you win or loose and lets you restart the game with a new word.

### Homework 3: Image Editing Using Matlab ###

This software is created in Matlab and has a few functions.
1. gris.m transforms a colored image to grayscale
2. binarizar.m transforms a grayscale image to black-and-white
3. convolucion.m convolutes the image, meaning, transforming an image by applying a kernel over each pixel and its local neighbors across the entire image
4. invertir.m inverts the black and white of the image
5. tarea6.m receives an image and applies the transformation using the functions from the previous steps
