Code is divided in 3 files:
* TareaIO.py is the main executable file
* sensibilidadQ.py makes calculations for different available inventory
* sensibilidadp1.py makes calculations for the scenario where we are certain with 100% probability that the product will have high exposure

Each py file generates a .txt with the results. The report is available in "Informe Tarea 1 IO.pdf".
