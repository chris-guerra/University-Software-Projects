### Homework 1: Stochastic Programming to Assign Prices of a Vinyard ###

This Homework consists in asigning prices of a product in a vinyards catalog for various periods and under restrictive and stochastic conditions. The optimization problem is displayed in the following image:

Code is divided in 3 files:
* TareaIO.py is the main executable file
* sensibilidadQ.py makes calculations for different available inventory
* sensibilidadp1.py makes calculations for the scenario where we are certain with 100% probability that the product will have high exposure

Each py file generates a .txt with the results. The report is available in "Informe Tarea 1 IO.pdf".

### Homework 2: Queueing theory of a real Cinema Line (Including χ2-distribution & Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) ###

This project involves obtaining real data from a Cinema Line to purchase tickets on a regular time and at peak peak time, to further understand demand tendencies, to predict behaviour and reduce costs. Arena software is used to obtain results. Both arrival times and customer service times are studied separately, the following images are the ones for regular times. The full report can be seen in Tarea_2_IO.pdf.

### Homework 3: Queueing theory, Predictions of a real Cinema Line ###

Based on the previous homework this consists of making predictions on arrivals, attention times and line exit times of customers from the collected data. The results are available in "Tarea 3 IO.pdf". The following image is a screenshot of simulation results on regular & peak schedules.
