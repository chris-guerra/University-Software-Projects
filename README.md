# University-Software-Projects

This Repo has many projects with their reports on results from different projects that where done as a student. Since courses where dictated in spanish, reports are also shown in spanish. Some projects due to the year created might be outdated, the results and code are displayed in each folder plus a README.md with an explanation and example of how the software works.

**2013 - Introduction to Programing:**
This course was the first university programing course. 3 out of 6 programs created in this course were uploaded: A pi estimator using Pascal's method and Montecarlo simulations, a simple hangman game using tkinter and finally a image editing software using matlab.
