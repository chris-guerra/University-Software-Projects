# University-Software-Projects, Optimization Models, Statistics & Machine Learning

This Repo has many projects with their reports on results from different projects that where done as a student. Since courses where dictated in spanish, reports are also shown in spanish. Some projects due to the year created might be outdated, the results and code are displayed in each folder plus a README.md with an explanation and example of how the software works.

**2016 - Operations Research:**
Three Projects had to be uploaded for this course, they involve Stochastic Programming, Queueing Theory and Statistics. Projects involve determining prices based on stochastic conditions and optimization restrictions, collecting data of real lines in a cinema, modelling behaviour with statistics (χ2-distribution & Kolmogorov–Smirnov) and predicting future behaviour to predict and reduce future costs.

**2015 - Information Tecnology:**
A website was created with object-oriented programing paradigm and MVC arquitecture. A relational database was created with SQL for sales, products and users. 4 clases where created: Sell Products, Generate Catalog, Buy Products, Customer Cart.

**2013 - Introduction to Programing:**
This course was the first university programing course. 3 out of 6 programs created in this course were uploaded: A pi estimator using Pascal's method and Montecarlo simulations, a simple hangman game using tkinter and finally a image editing software using matlab.
